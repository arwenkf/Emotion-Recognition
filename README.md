# Emotion-Recognition
This project is designed to create an app that will allow users to input a video/picture and using artificial intelligence and computer vision, the app will identify the emotion exhibited. It recognizes seven emotions: Anger, Disgust, Sadness, Happiness, Fear, Surprise, and Neutrality.

# Goals
- Help those who may have difficulty identifying and recognizing emotion
- To learn about Convolutional Neural Networks
- Learn about AI
- Train a custom Neural Network

# Development Status
- Nearly complete! AI is finished, and app is in development
- First benchmark will be fully completed by January 24th. This includes the ability to recognize emotions in pictures and log the emotions into the app's database

# How to run
At the moment, the files run perfectly, but are limited to local machines, since they rely upon file paths. However, once the app is completed, this will be solved. In the meantime, in order to be tested on other machines, the user would have to download the files and change a few file path variables. There is not need to download the whole neural network training file. Simply dowloading model.json, model_weights.h5, and process_image, you will be able to run the code on your own machine.
